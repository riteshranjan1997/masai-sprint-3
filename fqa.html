                                                    coronaviruses because the virus particle exhibits a characteristic

                                                    proteins around its lipid envelope. CoV infections are common in
                                                    animals and
                                                    humans. Some
                                                    strains of CoV are zoonotic, meaning they can be transmitted between

                                                    and humans, but
                                                    many strains are not zoonotic.

                                                    In humans, CoV can cause illness ranging from the common cold to

                                                    reported
                                                    in Wuhan City,
                                                    Hubei Province of China (People’s Rep. of). A new CoV was identified
                                                    as the
                                                    causative agent
                                                    by Chinese Authorities. Since then, human cases have been reported
                                                    by almost
                                                    all countries
                                                    around the world and the COVID-19 event has been declared by the

                                                    The CoV which causes COVID-19 has been named as SARS-CoV-2 by the
                                                    International Committee on
                                                    Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV); this is the scientific name. The virus
                                                    may also
                                                    be referred to
                                                    as “the COVID-19 virus” or “the virus responsible for COVID-19”.
                                                    COVID-19
                                                    refers to the
                                                    disease caused by the virus.

                                                    and unofficial information are also monitored daily.

                                                    The OIE has mobilised several technical working groups (‘ad hoc

                                                    scientific advice on research priorities, on-going research, and

                                                    The OIE has put in place an Incident Coordination System to

                                                    precautions:
                                                    <br>
                                                    • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased
                                                    hand rub or

                                                    soap and water.
                                                    Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                                                    alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
                                                    <br>
                                                    • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                                                    anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                                                    Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                                                    droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                                                    are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                                                    COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
                                                    <br>
                                                    • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                                                    Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                                                    Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                                                    nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                                                    can make you sick.
                                                    <br>
                                                    • Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                                                    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                                                    with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then

                                                    quite different.

                                                    1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care
                                                    takers,
                                                    and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
                                                    2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based
                                                    hand rub or soap and water
                                                    3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
                                                    4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
                                                    5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the
                                                    coloured side).
                                                    6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge
                                                    of
                                                    the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
                                                    7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your
                                                    chin.
                                                    8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from
                                                    behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face
                                                    and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces
                                                    of the mask.
                                                    9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
                                                    10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the
                                                    mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
                                                    your hands with soap and water.

                                                    and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of
                                                    the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
                                                    commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more

                                                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in
                                                    animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which
                                                    may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
                                                    associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by
                                                    dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not
                                                    yet been confirmed.
                                                    To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets,
                                                    avoid
                                                    direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.
                                                    Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat,
                                                    milk
                                                    or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods
                                                    and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

                                                    It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives
                                                    on
                                                    surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
                                                    suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on
                                                    the
                                                    COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
                                                    several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
                                                    surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
                                                    If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple
                                                    disinfectant
                                                    to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands
                                                    with
                                                    an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
                                                    touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
